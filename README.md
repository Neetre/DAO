# DAO

## Description

DAO is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to create and manage their own decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Users can create a DAO by deploying a smart contract on the DAO blockchain, which will then be used to govern the organization. The smart contract can be customized to include various rules and parameters that will dictate how the organization operates.
